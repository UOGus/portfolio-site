      <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg">
        This project was focused on sentiment analysis of movie reviews using machine learning. This model analyzes how much each review is in the positive or negative direction, then produces an average sentiment score, which is meant to be a more accurate review score. The training step just consisted of TF-IDF vectorization and Select K Best preprocessing before fitting an SVM model to the generated weights. I used a dataset of 50,000 IMDB reviews to train the model. See the source code below:
