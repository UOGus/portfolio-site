      This project was my first experience working in post production on a film. I learned about procedural texture programming, 
      perspective matching using camera data, and the process of taking direction from a client. The biggest challenge of this project was 
      creating a convincing procedural bone texture. I first tried using free assets from the internet, but they kept looking out of place in 
      the scene. My final texture consisted of multiple layers of weathering effects with a final layer of dirt blending the base of the model 
      with the ground, and I'm happy with how it turned out! See the final results below:
